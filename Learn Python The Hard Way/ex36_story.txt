Once upon a time their was a boy name 'Ichabod Crane' who loves a girl name 'Grace Abigail' known by 'Abbie'. 
One day they were playing hide and seek and the girl has to hide somewhere so at a nearby distance she saw a house 
and she thought it would be nice place to hide. As the front door was locked so she climbed up on that door and she 
jumped inside and she felt and she was also bleeding and she drop one of her earings in front of the gate on the inside side.

Ichabod was looking for her but he didn't find her, after some time he also found that house, he went near to the front and he looked at
one of her earings, so he climbed up he jumbed in and picked up her earings.
